It is a simple project that appearn most famous series of the netflix. It is just a practice of react, react-components, react-props and map function in react. Props are just like the properties of the component on react.

Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. props stands for properties.

We have used Array to store the all the data of the Cards ex. sname, title, imgsrc and link.

The map() method creates a new array by calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. by just putting val as the argument we fetch all the elements in CardData array.

Run project by:
npm start
